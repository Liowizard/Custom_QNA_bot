Chennai Cloud & Data Centre Convention Digital India programme has created ripples with far outreaching effects that go beyond the realm of industries; it has turned itself into a mass movement where every state and its people now actively have a stake in the emerging digital economy. One state that pledged to grow and revive and contribute heavily to India’s GDP is Tamil Nadu. Till now, the Southern metropolis which always has been a ‘favourable’ investment destination, has attracted over Rs.50,000 crores proposals. In the industrial ecosystem, Tamil Nadu, so far, has been leading automobile, wind energy, and electronics hardware manufacturing; however, owing to the stable system of governance and guidance by the top economists, Tamil Nadu will soon emerge as the data centre capital of India. The government’s adherence to providing power, land, and connectivity infrastructure for DCs, fiscal and non-fiscal incentives, and promoting renewable energy use for everyday management has created a supportive technology bubble for industries to set up data centres. However, the endless opportunities also raise the concern of security. Being the 1st state to come up with ethical AI, blockchain, cyber security policies in the country, the state is already one step ahead in having its foundational ground secured and safeguarded. As Tamil Nadu is gearing up to provide a ready, built and well-established supply chain for data centres to integrate scale within the state, we, at W.Media, to give a fillip to their efforts are now coming up with the Chennai Cloud & Data Centre Convention.

Registration Process  - offline Facial verification
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use clear and even lighting.
Ensure only one person is in front of the camera.
Check for unwanted faces or objects in the background.
if person is wearing specs make sure no light reflection in eye glass
Position the camera at eye level.
Facial Authentication 
-----------------------------------------------

 1,How long will it take to verify my image?

Image verification will take 5-10 seconds for the first time of installation or update of the app. From the second time onwards, it will be very quick depending on your device.

 

2,What should I do if I face facial verification failure?

If you face facial verification failure more than 2 times, please try uninstalling and reinstalling the app. If your image fails more than 3 times consecutively, please contact the support team.


3,How can I ensure a successful facial verification?

Ensure that your lighting is clear and there is only one person in front of the camera, with no unwanted faces or objects in the background. If you wear spectacles, make sure there are no reflections in the mirror.
 

4,How do I take a facial verification on iOS?

To take a facial verification on iOS, you need to blink once during the process.

 

5,How do I take a facial verification on Android?

To take a facial verification on Android, simply click on the take photo icon. The verification process will automatically begin.

 

6,What Android versions are supported for offline verifications? 

A: Although we support older versions of Android, we recommend Android 9.0 Pie (2018) and above for the best experience with offline verifications.

 

7,What iOS versions does Digiclass support?
Digiclass supports iOS 10 and newer versions. We recommend using iOS 12 or later for the best experience.

 

 

Facial Authentication with liveness 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

What is facial liveness in the Digiclass app?

 Facial liveness is a process that ensures the user is present during facial recognition and prevents fraudulent activity.

 

How does facial liveness work in the app?

 Facial liveness checks for spontaneous actions like blinks or facial expressions to verify the user's presence.

 

What happens if I fail the facial liveness check?

 If you fail, try again and follow the prompts correctly.

 

How long does the facial liveness check take? 

It only takes a few seconds, and a random blink prompt appears for 3 seconds out of a 10-second time frame. Properly blink during those 3 seconds to avoid failure.
